## When to consider OpenPAI
1. When your organization needs to share powerful AI computing resources (GPU/FPGA farm, etc.) among teams.
2. When your organization needs to share and reuse common AI assets like Model, Data, Environment, etc.
3. When your organization needs an easy IT ops platform for AI.
4. When you want to run a complete training pipeline in one place.


## Why choose OpenPAI
The platform incorporates the mature design that has a proven track record in Microsoft's large-scale production environment.

### Support on-premises and easy to deploy

OpenPAI is a full stack solution. OpenPAI not only supports on-premises, hybrid, or public Cloud deployment but also supports single-box deployment for trial users.

### Support popular AI frameworks and heterogeneous hardware

Pre-built docker for popular AI frameworks. Easy to include heterogeneous hardware. Support Distributed training, such as distributed TensorFlow.

### Most complete solution and easy to extend

OpenPAI is a most complete solution for deep learning, support virtual cluster, compatible Hadoop / kubernetes eco-system, complete training pipeline at one cluster etc. OpenPAI is architected in a modular way: different module can be plugged in as appropriate.

## Related Projects
Targeting at openness and advancing state-of-art technology, [Microsoft Research (MSR)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-research-group-asia/) had also released few other open source projects.
* [NNI](https://github.com/Microsoft/nni) : An open source AutoML toolkit for neural architecture search and hyper-parameter tuning.
We encourage researchers and students leverage these projects to accelerate the AI development and research.
* [MMdnn](https://github.com/Microsoft/MMdnn) : A comprehensive, cross-framework solution to convert, visualize and diagnose deep neural network models. The "MM" in MMdnn stands for model management and "dnn" is an acronym for deep neural network.

## How to deploy
#### 1 Prerequisites <a name="ref_prerequisites"></a>
Before start, you need to meet the following requirements:

- Ubuntu 16.04
- Assign each server a static IP address. Network is reachable between servers.
- Server can access the external network, especially need to have access to a Docker registry service (e.g., Docker hub) to pull the Docker images for the services to be deployed.
- All machines' SSH service is enabled, share the same username / password and have sudo privilege.
- Need to enable NTP service.
- Recommend no Docker installed or a Docker with api version >= 1.26.
- See [hardware resource requirements](https://github.com/Microsoft/pai/wiki/Resource-Requirement).

#### 2 Deploy OpenPAI

If you have a cluster which contains more than 2 machine and want to deploy pai on it. Please choose ```Distributed deploy``` following.

If you only have one mahince, and want to deploy pai on it. Please choose ```Single Box deploy``` following.
