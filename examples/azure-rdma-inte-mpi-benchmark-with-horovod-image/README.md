## Intel MPI benchmark in OpenPAI based on Azure's RDMA Capable machines.

#### Prerequisites

Please contact with your cluster admin to ensure that whether azure rdma is enabled in your cluster or not.

#### Prepare build an image with necessary library.

To run AzureRDMA&IntelMPI benchmark in OpenPAI, you need to prepare a job configuration file and submit it through webportal.

Users should prepare their own intel mpi licences to build the docker image. When building docker image, please refer to [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md)

- For more details on how to write a job configuration file, please refer to [job tutorial](../../docs/job_tutorial.md#json-config-file-for-job-submission).
- Sleep 1000 in ```master-0``` is a hack to ensure that all work containers are ready. You could optimize it in a better way. For example try to ssh all the work containers with the hostanme ```${taskname}-${taskid}``` until sccessful.
- If user wanna a AZ-RDMA capable container. The following parameter is necessary.
```bash
"jobEnvs": {
    "paiAzRDMA": true
  }
```
